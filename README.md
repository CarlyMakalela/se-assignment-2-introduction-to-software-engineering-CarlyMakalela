# What software Engineering is and how it differs from traditional programming

Software engineering is a comprehensive discipline that applies engineering principles to the entire software development lifecycle, including requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, maintenance, and project management. It involves systematic and quantifiable approaches, often using methodologies like Agile and DevOps, and emphasizes collaboration among diverse team members. How it differs from traditional programming is that, traditional programming focuses mainly on writing code to implement specific functionalities, with less emphasis on the broader development process. While software engineering ensures thorough testing, quality assurance, and considers long-term maintenance and scalability, traditional programming typically involves individual or small team efforts aimed at immediate problem-solving, potentially overlooking the formalized processes and long-term considerations inherent to software engineering. (Sommerville, 2016) (Bhatia, 2020)
